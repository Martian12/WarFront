                Last week the United Nations discovered a mass grave in Sudan's West Darfur in which 87 people 
                were buried, prompting the UN high commissioner for Human Rights to demand a “thorough 
                and independent investigation” into activity in the region.

                 <br>
                 It is the latest troubling news to come out of the country, 
                 which has been in a state of conflict since April, when fighting broke out between 
                 rival groups. In the three months since, 3.1 million people have been displaced, 
                 thousands are thought to have been killed and even more wounded, 
                 with entire neighbourhoods destroyed.
                <br>
                <br>
                UN agencies have received credible reports of 21 incidents of conflict-related sexual 
                violence against at least 57 women and girls – in one of the incidents as many as 20 
                women were reportedly raped in the same attack. There have been reports of 
                extrajudicial killings, ethnic violence, and widespread hunger, with a former UN 
                humanitarian coordinator describing what is happening in Sudan as having “all the 
                signature characteristics of genocide”. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Peace talks were suspended last month as both sides continued to violate ceasefires. 
                Over the weekend, representatives for the Sudanese army reportedly returned to Saudi 
                Arabia for peace talks, indicating that they are open to diplomatic avenues for ending the conflict, 
                though expectations are low.

           <p>1. The United Nations discovered a mass grave in Sudan's West Darfur, containing 87 bodies, 
           prompting calls for an independent investigation into the region's activities.</p>

           <p>2. Since April, Sudan has been embroiled in conflict, resulting in 3.1 million people being displaced, 
           thousands killed, and many wounded. The violence has led to the destruction of entire neighborhoods.</p>

           <p>4. The situation has witnessed extrajudicial killings, ethnic violence, and widespread hunger. 
           A former UN humanitarian coordinator described it as having "all the signature characteristics of genocide."</p>

           <p>5. Peace talks were suspended as both sides continued to violate ceasefires, exacerbating the ongoing conflict.</p>

           <p>6. The Sudanese army has engaged in a bloodthirsty battle alongside the Rapid Support Force (RSF), hindering any resolution prospects.</p>

           <p>7. Neighboring countries are concerned about the potential for the violence to 
           escalate into an all-out civil war, leading to a crisis in the region.
            The evolving conflict poses significant challenges for both Ukrainian and Russian forces, 
            with potential implications for the regional and global security landscape. 
            Further developments in the coming days may shape the course of the conflict and its impact on the involved parties and the international community.</p>
