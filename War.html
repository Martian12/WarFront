        <h3>Russo-Ukrainian War</h3>
        <p>In early 2014, the Euromaidan protests led to the ousting of Ukraine's 
          pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, and sparked ongoing conflicts with Russia. 
          In 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to international condemnation and a devastating 
          war with thousands of casualties.</p>
