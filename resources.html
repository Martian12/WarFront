        <h3>The Guns of August by Barbara W. Tuchman</h3>
        <p>For anyone who want to understand more about the first 
            few months of World War I, The Guns of August is a must-read. 
            The book first discusses the events leading up to the conflict 
            before giving a thorough account of the British-French effort to 
            prevent the German army from reaching Paris. The book is a great 
            resource for learning more about the horrors of trench warfare and
             how they came to dominate the conflict.</p>

        <h3>They Shall Not Grow Old</h3>
        <p>The 2018 documentary They Shall Not Grow Old was made and directed by Peter Jackson. 
            The video was made utilising authentic First World War footage from the Imperial War Museum's archives, 
            the majority of which had never been seen before and was, at the time of its publication, more than a century old. 
            The audio comes from Imperial War Museum (IWM) and BBC interviews with British service members who participated in the war. 
            The majority of the footage has been coloured and altered using contemporary production methods, 
            and voice acting and sound effects have been added to make it more evocative and feel more like the troops' 
            actual experiences.</p>
