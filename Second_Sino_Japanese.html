                Japan's invasion of China in the early 1930s and the Sino-Japanese War that followed 
                was the culmination of decades of antagonism between the two nations.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Full-scale war between China and Japan began in July 1937, following an incident 
                 near the Marco Polo Bridge in Wanping, near Beijing. After Japanese troops opened 
                 fire on local soldiers a brief ceasefire was negotiated but both sides increased 
                 military numbers in the region.

                 When the Japanese launched a full-scale invasion of China in late July, 
                 the Nationalists and CCP were seven months into a shaky alliance dubbed the Second 
                 United Front.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Nationalist armies attempted to resist the invasion but were quickly overcome by the 
                technological supremacy and preparedness of the Japanese. China's underdeveloped industries 
                were incapable of supplying munitions or engineering quickly or in sufficient quantities. 
                Unlike the Japanese, the Chinese military had no tanks and only a few aircraft.

                 <h3>Rapid Japanese Advances</h3>  
                 <p>
                    The first phase of the war was a blitzkrieg of Japanese victories as their 
                    forces moved swiftly along China's east coast.

                    Almost half a million Japanese troops moved against Shanghai, 
                    Nanjing and other locations in mainland China, while Japanese military planes 
                    bombarded regions where their foot soldiers could not penetrate.

                    In late 1937 the Nationalist government was forced to retreat from its capital, 
                    Nanjing, to Chongqing in western China.

                 <h3>Japanese Brutalities</h3>
                 <p>
                    Japanese troops in China were notorious for their brutal treatment of 
                    civilians and military prisoners.
                    The Japanese occupation of Nanjing from December 1937, often referred to as 
                    the 'Rape of Nanjing', is the most infamous example of Japanese brutality. 
                    Estimates suggest that the Japanese massacred 300,000 people in and around 
                    the city, many of them civilians.

                    <br><br>
                    According to contemporary accounts, thousands of civilians were buried alive, 
                    machine-gunned or used for bayonet practice. Females were taken and forced 
                    into labour as “comfort women” (sex slaves for Japanese officers and soldiers).


                    The Japanese also conducted human experimentation in secret bases in China. 
                    Unit 731 in the country’s northeast was the largest biological and chemical 
                    warfare testing facility. Prisoners there were injected with diseases like 
                    anthrax, smallpox, cholera, dysentery and typhoid. Other experiments studied 
                    the effects of food deprivation and extreme cold; amputation without 
                    anaesthesia; and the effects of chemical weapons and flamethrowers.


                 </p>
                 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                 <p>
                    The Second Sino-Japanese War came to an end in August 1945 after the 
                    United States detonated nuclear weapons over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
                    Russian troops invaded from the north and suppressed Japanese forces 
                    in Manchuria, while Japanese forces in China were ordered to surrender 
                    to Jiang Jieshi and the Nationalists.

                    <br><br>    

                    In assessing the impact of the war, historian Jonathan Fenby describes it as 
                    “an extended body blow for a regime already shot through with weaknesses. 
                    The length, scale and nature of the conflict had debilitated China and the 
                    Nationalists”.

                    <br><br>

                    China emerged from the war politically unsettled, 
                    economically exhausted and scarred by an enormous amount of human suffering. 
                    With the CCP growing in size, popularity and prestige, 
                    and the Guomindang government grossly unpopular, 
                    the Chinese stage was now cleared for a civil war between the 
                    Nationalists and the communists.

            <h3>Key Points</h3>
            1. The Second Sino-Japanese War had its roots in decades of tension between the two nations. In contrast to the modernised and highly militarised Japanese, Chinese republican forces lacked training, equipment and a strong industrial base.
            <br><br>
            2. Already with a foothold in northern China, and armed with superior military technologies, the Japanese invaded in July 1937. They rapidly occupied the east coast of China in 1938-39.
            <br><br>
            3. The Japanese used inhumane and sadistic methods during their occupation of China, typified by events like the Nanjing Massacre and their use of human experimentation.
            <br><br>
            4. Jiang Jieshi was widely criticised for his wartime leadership, for placing more importance on the struggle against the communists than the Japanese. He also led a corrupt government plagued by economic issues and failed to work effectively with China’s foreign allies.
            <br><br>
            5. The war left the Nationalist government in a vulnerable position, while the CCP managed to consolidate and expand their support, placing them in a more favourable position as China moved towards civil war.

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) was a military conflict that was 
                primarily waged between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. 
                The war made up the Chinese theater of the wider Pacific Theater of the 
                Second World War
