            <h2>Vietnam War</h2>
            <p>Date: 1954 - 1975 </p>
            <p>Source: The Guardian
            </p>
            <p>
                During the late fifties, Vietnam was divided into a communist North and 
                anti-communist South. Because of the Cold War anxiety of the time, the general 
                feeling was that, should the North Vietnamese communists win, the remainder of 
                Southeast Asia would also fall to communism. When President John F. Kennedy took 
                office in 1961, he swore that he would not let that happen.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 In August 1964, the US government received word that two North Vietnamese 
                 torpedo boats attacked US destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin. 
                 President Lyndon Johnson requested authorization from Congress for the use 
                 of military force, resulting in the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which laid 
                 the groundwork for the full-scale US military commitment to Vietnam. 
                 The resolution declared the support of Congress for “all necessary measures 
                 to repel any armed attack against the armed forces of the United States and 
                 to prevent further aggression.”


                <br>
                <br>
                The 1968 Tet Offensive, a bold North Vietnamese attack on the south, 
                convinced many US officials that the war could not be won at a reasonable cost. 
                Heightened opposition to the war was one of the major factors in Johnson's 
                decision not to run for re-election in 1968.
                <br>
                <br>
                The war in Vietnam had lasting consequences for US foreign policy. 
                Congress passed the War Powers Act in 1973, in a clear attempt to 
                reassert a measure of control over the making of foreign policy and to 
                impose constraints on presidential power. For well over a decade, 
                American public opinion was hostile to the idea of foreign interventions. 
                This was known as the “Vietnam syndrome,” and it entailed an unwillingness 
                to become bogged down in foreign wars in which American national security 
                interests were unclear.

            <h3>Key Points</h3>
            <p>
               




           <p>1. The Vietnam War was a prolonged military conflict that started as 
               an anticolonial war against the French and evolved into a Cold War 
               confrontation between international communism and free-market democracy.</p>

           <p>2. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in the north was supported by the Soviet Union, China, 
               and other communist countries, while the United States and its anticommunist allies backed 
               the Republic of Vietnam (ROV) in the south.</p>

           <p>3. President Lyndon Johnson dramatically escalated US involvement in the conflict, authorizing a series of intense bombing campaigns and committing hundreds of thousands of US ground troops to the fight.
        </p>

           <p>4. After the United States withdrew from the conflict, North Vietnam 
               invaded the South and united the country under a communist government.</p>


            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Vietnam War, a protracted conflict that pitted the communist 
                government of North Vietnam and its allies in South Vietnam, known as the Viet 
                Cong, against the government of South Vietnam and its principal ally, the United 
                States. Called the “American War” in Vietnam (or, in full, the “War Against the 
                Americans to Save the Nation”), the war was also part of a larger regional 
                conflict (see Indochina wars) and a manifestation of the Cold War between the 
                United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies.
